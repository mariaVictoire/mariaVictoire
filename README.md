# Welcome to this GitHub project!

Initially, this project will focus on solving the famous Mastermind problem using an approach based on genetic algorithms. Next, attention turns to solving the Traveller's Problem (TSP), again exploiting the capabilities of genetic algorithms, while retaining as far as possible the key elements of the first program developed.

Finally, a crucial step is to generalize the code developed, in order to create a common base capable of solving a wide range of optimization problems.
