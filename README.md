# Welcome to this GitHub project!

Initially, this project will focus on solving the famous Mastermind problem using an approach based on genetic algorithms. Next, attention turns to solving the Traveller's Problem (TSP), again exploiting the capabilities of genetic algorithms, while retaining as far as possible the key elements of the first program developed.

Finally, a crucial step is to generalize the code developed, in order to create a common base capable of solving a wide range of optimization problems.

# So, how does it work?

## Solving the Mastermind problem with a genetic algorithm :
In this section, we implement a genetic algorithm to solve the Mastermind logic game, where you have to guess a secret color combination.



## Solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) with a genetic algorithm:
Here, we've adapted the previously coded genetic algorithm to solve the famous Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the objective is to find the shortest path through a set of cities only once.

## Generalizing code to solve different problems :
Finally, we generalized our code to solve different optimization problems.
